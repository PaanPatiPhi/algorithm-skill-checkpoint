/*  
What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer:
O(n^2) because we have to use nested loop which compares each element with other element in the array, 
such as "products[0] with products[1]","products[0] with products[2]","products[0] with products[3]"
